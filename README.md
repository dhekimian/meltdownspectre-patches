# meltdownspectre-patches
Summary of the patch status for Meltdown / Spectre

What?
=====

Meltdown and Spectre are hardware design vulnerabilities in all modern CPUs based on
speculative execution. Background infos:

 * https://spectreattack.com/ or https://meltdownattack.com/ (both pages serve identical content)
 * https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.dk/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html

The bug is in the hardware, but mitigations in operating systems are possible and are getting
shipped now. I'm collecting notes on the patch status in various software products. This will
change rapidly and may contain errors. If you have better info please send pull requests.

Spectre & Meltdown Checkers
=====
(Use at your own risk)
* Linux: Stéphane Lesimple [put together](https://github.com/speed47/spectre-meltdown-checker) a simple shell script to tell if your Linux installation is vulnerable against the 3 "speculative execution" CVEs.
* Microsoft Windows: See the [Windows](#windows) section in this document containing the link to the official Powershell script.

PoCs
=====

* In a [recent tweet](https://twitter.com/mlqxyz/status/950744467736354816), Moritz Lipp (Graz University of Technology) has announced the release of their PoC implementations for Meltdown. 
  * [GitHub repository](https://github.com/iaik/meltdown)
* In a [recent tweet](https://twitter.com/tehjh/status/950774905544507393), Jann Horn (Google's Project Zero) has announced that the PoC code referenced in their recent blogpost about CPUs is now public.
* The LSDS group at Imperial College London [has published sample code](https://github.com/lsds/spectre-attack-sgx) demonstrating a Spectre-like attack against an Intel SGX enclave.

Linux upstream kernel
=====================

[Kernel Page Table Isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_page-table_isolation#cite_note-:2-4)
is a mitigation in the Linux Kernel, originally named KAISER.

 * [Version 4.14.11](https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.14.11) contains KPTI.
 * [Version 4.15-rc6](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?h=v4.15-rc6) contains KPTI.
 * Longterm support kernels [Version 4.9.75](https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.9.75) and [4.4.110](https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.4.110) contain KPTI backports.

Noteworthy:
 * Comment by kernel developer Andrew Lutomirski [that pre-4.14 kernels got an earlier version of KPTI and may contain bugs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16087736).
 * [Explanation of PCID](https://archive.fo/ma8Iw), which will reduce performance impact of KPTI on newer kernels.

minipli patches
===============

minipli is an unofficial fork of the former grsecurity patches (original grsecurity is no longer publicly
available). minipli is based on the longterm kernel 4.9, which supports KPTI since
4.9.75, yet the patchset isn't ported yet.

 * [bug report with discussion about backporting KPTI](https://github.com/minipli/linux-unofficial_grsec/issues/25)

Android
=======

 * Fixed with [Android Security Bulletin—January 2018](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2018-01-01).

Windows

**Update - Tue 9 Jan 09:00 UTC**

Microsoft has reports of some customers with AMD devices getting into an unbootable state after installing [this KB](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4056892/windows-10-update-kb4056892). To prevent this issue, Microsoft will temporarily pause Windows OS updates to devices with impacted AMD processors (older CPUs, eg. Athlon and Sempron) at this time. Microsoft is working with AMD to resolve this issue and resume Windows OS security updates to the affected AMD devices via Windows Update and WSUS as soon as possible. If you have experienced an unbootable state or for more information see [KB4073707](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4073707). For AMD specific information please contact AMD.
   

Apple
====

Apple has already released mitigations in iOS 11.2, macOS 10.13.2, and tvOS 11.2 to help defend against Meltdown. 

* [Official statement](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208394)

**Update Mon 8 Jan 18:00 UTC**

Apple has released security improvements to Safari and WebKit to mitigate the effects of Spectre (CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715):
* [macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 Supplemental Update](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208397)
* [Safari 11.0.2](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208403) for Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 and macOS Sierra 10.12.6
* [iOS 11.2.2 update](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208401) for iPhone and iPad

 
**Update - Sun 7 Jan 2018, 9:00 UTC**

Based on the Apple's response posted [here](https://twitter.com/GraveSpy720/status/949489861886537728), Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754) is currently only addressed in iOS 11.2, macOS 10.13.2, and tvOS 11.2. Apple cannot say at this time if there will be updates to OS versions prior to the ones listed in their article at this time. The same can be said for Spectre (CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715) and any updates for Safari. This means that at this given time there are NO patches for 10.11.x (El Capitan) or 10.12.x (Sierra).

 * Ubuntu (tl;dr: Patches for Meltdown now available; subsequent patches for *Spectre* are coming in the future before the kernels are pushed to official release branch)
   The first set of updates for 14.04 / 16.04 was broken on some systems, please make sure you update to the very latest kernel packages and avoid the broken ones.
 **Update - Sun 7 Jan 2018, 22:00 UTC**  
 Release candidate kernels 4.4.x (Trusty HWE / Xenial GA) and 4.13.x (Xenial HWE-edge / Artful GA / Artful HWE) are now publicly available from a [dedicated Launchpad PPA](https://launchpad.net/~canonical-kernel-team/+archive/ubuntu/pti/) and currently contain patches for CVE-2017-5754 *aka Meltdown*, with support only some architactures. Support for a broader array of architectures and patches for CVE-2017-5715 and CVE-2017-5753 *aka Spectre* are expected in the near future.
 After some testing, the patched kernels will be pushed to the main release branch.  
  **Update - Mon 8 Jan 2018, 16:00 UTC**  
 Canonical Ltd. announced that, in order to speed up the patching process for all supported distribution versions and branches, the 4.10.x *Xenial HWE* kernel will be migrated early to version 4.13.x, thus leaving no supported kernel branch exposed to vulnerabilities. The migration will occur concurrently to the push of patched kernels to the main distribution repositories.
 In addition, Ubuntu 17.04, aka *Zesty Zapus*, will [reach End Of Life](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2018-January/000227.html) on Sat 13 Jan 2018 and will not receive any kind kernel patch support.

**Update - Thu 4 Jan 2018, 15:30 UTC**

It seems that the new Intel’s microcode archive (2017-12-15) provided with the latest Red Hat’s microcode_ctl update includes three new files: 06-3f-02, 06-4f-01, 06-55-04.

Based on what we know:
1. it adds one new CPUID and two MSR for the variant of Spectre that uses indirect branches
2. it forces LFENCE to terminate the execution of all previous instructions, thus having the desired effect for the variant of Spectre that uses conditional branches (out-of-bounds-bypass)

Those IDs belong to the following processor microarchitectures: Haswell, Broadwell, Skylake ([official reference](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-architecture-and-processor-identification-with-cpuid-model-and-family-numbers))

**Update - Thu 4 Jan 2018, 16:30 UTC**

Regarding AMD's microcode update: it seems to be only for EPYC (maybe Ryzen, not sure!) and it only adds one of the two MSRs (IA32_PRED_CMD). It uses a different bit than Intel's in the CPUID. It is also for Spectre with indirect branches. Previous microprocessors resolved it with a chicken bit. Please note that the same solution implemented at kernel level works for both Intel and AMD.

**Update - Fri 5 Jan 2018, 03:35 UTC**

Debian Project package maintainers released an [updated version of the "intel-microcode" package (version 2017-12-15)](https://packages.debian.org/sid/intel-microcode) for the Sid (unstable) branch olny. Upon inspection, it seems to contain the same microcode additions observed in the Red Hat microcode_ctl update of Thu 4 Jan 2018, 15:30 UTC.
The package in compatible with all Debian-based distributions that support post-boot microcode updates.

Antiviruses
===========

Some Antiviruses do things that break when installing the Windows patches, therefore Microsoft doesn't automatically install the patches on those systems.
